\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

The main sources of information are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item the TypeDB documentation available on the
  web\footnote{\url{https://docs.vaticle.com/}},
  henceforth referenced as [DOC];
\item a video about knowledge
  graphs\footnote{\url{https://vaticle.com/use-cases/knowledge-graphs}},
  henceforth referenced as [KGV], or for a particular instant (minute, second)
  within this video as [KGV:min:sec] or simply [KGV:min]
\end{itemize}

When the documentation does not
provide a unique answer, we have conducted experiments with TypeDB to
investigate the effective system behavior, see \secref{sec:questions}.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{The Type System, Conceptually}\label{sec:type_system_conceptually}

The following gives an abstract account of the TypeDB type system.

%......................................................................
\subsection{Structural description}

We distinguish three levels of structural description:
\begin{itemize}
\item Kinds (\secref{sec:structure_kinds}) are predefined concepts of the meta-model
\item Types (\secref{sec:structure_types}) are user-definable entities of a DB
  schema. A type is of a kind.
\item Instances (\secref{sec:structure_instances}) are user-definable entities
  of a DB. An instance is of a type.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Kinds}\label{sec:structure_kinds}

The meta-model is composed of the following elements which we refer to as
\emph{kinds}, also see [KGV:16]:
\begin{itemize}
\item Thing
\item Attribute
\item Entity
\item Relation
\item Role
\end{itemize}
In the following treatment, we ignore rules, which are also mentioned in the
meta-model.

In the meta-model:
\begin{itemize}
\item Attribute, Entity, Relation are related to Thing via a \texttt{sub}
  relation;
\item each of Entity, Attribute, Relation, Role is related to itself via a
  \texttt{sub} relation;
\item Thing is related to Attribute via an \texttt{owns} relation;
\item Relation is related to Role via a \texttt{relates} relation;
\item Thing is related to Role via a \texttt{plays} relation.
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Kind rules}


$$
\infer{\Gamma \vdash kind(Attribute)}{}
\quad
\infer{\Gamma \vdash kind(Entity)}{}
\quad
\infer{\Gamma \vdash kind(Relation)}{}
\quad
\infer{\Gamma \vdash kind(Role)}{}
$$



\subsubsection{Types}\label{sec:structure_types}

In a schema definition (following the keyword \texttt{define}), new
(attribute; entity; relation; role) types are introduced with the keyword
\texttt{sub}. These subtype relations are gathered in a context. For a subtype
declaration, we write $T' \preceq T$ instead of \texttt{T' sub T}.

\paragraph{Well-formedness rules} The following rules define well-formedness
of a context. The function $names$ retrieves all the newly introduced names of
a context.\remms{TBD}

$$
  \infer{wf(\Gamma, E \preceq T)}{
  wf(\Gamma) & E \notin names(\Gamma)
}
$$


\paragraph{Judgement: Type is of a Kind (rule set~1)}
The following rules derive a judgement $\Gamma \vdash T: K$ saying that type
$T$ is of kind $K$, where $K$ is one of the four kinds of
\secref{sec:structure_kinds}. For example, one could derive: 
$person \preceq entity \vdash person: Entity$.

Base case:
$$
\infer{\Gamma \vdash \mathtt{attribute} : Attribute}{}
\quad
\infer{\Gamma \vdash \mathtt{entity} : Entity}{}
\quad
\infer{\Gamma \vdash \mathtt{relation} : Relation}{}
\quad
\infer{\Gamma \vdash \mathtt{role} : Role}{}
$$

Subtype:
$$
\infer{\Gamma, T' \preceq T \vdash T' : K}{
  wf(\Gamma, T' \preceq T) & \Gamma \vdash T : K 
}
$$

Weakening:
$$
\infer{\Gamma, \Gamma' \vdash T : K}{
  wf(\Gamma, \Gamma')
  & 
  \Gamma \vdash T : K
}
$$


\paragraph{Judgement: Type is of a Kind (rule set~2)}

One may doubt that \texttt{entity} is itself a type (and similarly for
\texttt{attribute} etc.), see the questions in
\secref{sec:questions_type_decls}.

Base case:
$$
\infer{\Gamma, T' \preceq K \vdash T' : K}{
  wf(\Gamma, T' \preceq K)  & kind(K)
}
$$

Subtype:
$$
\infer{\Gamma, T' \preceq T \vdash T' : K}{
  wf(\Gamma, T' \preceq T) & \Gamma \vdash T : K 
}
$$

Weakening:
$$
\infer{\Gamma, \Gamma' \vdash T : K}{
  wf(\Gamma, \Gamma')
  & 
  \Gamma \vdash T : K
}
$$

\section{Open and Solved Questions}\label{sec:questions}

%......................................................................
\subsection{Type Declarations}\label{sec:questions_type_decls}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Is it possible to introduce the same name both as an entity and as a
  relation type, something like:

  \begin{alltt}
    Foo sub entity;
    Foo sub relation;
  \end{alltt}

\item Is the type hierarchy acyclic, or is it possible to have
  \begin{alltt}
    C1 sub C2;
    C2 sub C1;
  \end{alltt}
  or to introduce a type several times, like
  \begin{alltt}
    C sub entity;
    C1 sub C;
    C2 sub C;
    D sub C1;
    D sub C2;
  \end{alltt}

\item It is not clear whether \texttt{entity} is indeed a type or only a kind
  in the sense of \secref{sec:structure_kinds}. Syntactically, it does not
  seem possible to declare a relation that has \texttt{entity} as its domain.

  A similar question holds for \texttt{attribute}. Would it be possible to
  write the following?

  \begin{alltt}
  e sub entity,
    owns attribute;
  \end{alltt}

  Probably not, because (semantically) the attribute would not have an
  associated value. A follow-up question to this is if attribute definitions
  can have 0 or $\geq 2$ associated \texttt{value} declarations, such as in
  \begin{alltt}
    a sub attribute;
  \end{alltt}
  (without value),  or
  \begin{alltt}
    a sub attribute,
    value string,
    value long;
  \end{alltt}
  (with several incompatible value declarations).
  
  
\end{enumerate}


%......................................................................
\subsection{Objects and Identities}

\begin{enumerate}
\item We have already tried out to create two entities having identical
  attributes but which become two distinct objects.

  The question is whether there are also multi-relations, i.e. two entities
  can be related by the same relation several times.
\end{enumerate}
